# Lib2Kindle

Searches Libgen database and sends to Kindle (Incomplete)

Meant to be a personal project to practice Java and JavaFX while making something useful for myself. It'll get the values properly (unless I committed and pushed the wrong version, which is very possible since I've only recently become a convert and believer in VCS due to unfortunate act of god disasters that I could have never forseen and was obviously never ever ever warned would happen to me if I didn't listen and commit and push regularly. :/

But yeah, without the GUI and the actual component to download file and send it to the approved kindle email, this is just a glorified JSON call.

## Improvements Needed

- Needs GUI.
- Needs component to allow the user to select download and send to a user-set email automatically.
- Having more databases to search would be nice too.
